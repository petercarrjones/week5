This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r,}
library(historydata)
data(us_state_populations)
pops <- us_state_populations
pops$year <- as.Date.character(pops$year, "%Y")
va.data<-c()
va.data <- subset(pops, subset=(pops$state=="Virginia" ))
summary(va.data)
library(ggplot2)
vaplot <- ggplot(data=va.data, aes(year, y=population))
summary(vaplot)
vaplot + geom_line()
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
