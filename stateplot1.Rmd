This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Call history data library
library(historydata)
#pull in us_state_population data
data(us_state_populations)
#change to easy variable
pops <- us_state_populations
#create subset of dataset - all observations 1850 and before
ma.data<-c()
ma.data <- subset(pops, subset=(pops$year <= 1850 ))
summary(ma.data)
#Call ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)
#plot state counts in a histogram (function: stars on the flag)
maplot <- qplot(data = ma.data, x=state, geom=  "histogram" )
#Use the Black and White theme
last_plot() + theme_bw()

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
